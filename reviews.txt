my second time here and true to say it was better than the first which was excellent 
the staff here are amazing beyond expectations

richard the chef this guy is like the friendliest guy ever such a nice guy with a permanent smile 
oh yeah the food is great to and very reasonable prices 
even the cleaning lady is so friendly and so nice to talk to 
the rooms are spacious and clean great to stay i even got an upgrade which is always so nice 
the owners are also great it is like a real caring family set up

i do not think i need to mention where i will be staying next time i am in larnaka 
brilliant guys
the staff were exceptional so helpful and friendly went out of their way for us the breakfast was lovely with room service too very clean and comfortable couldn t stay longer
we stayed week and enjoyed it very much the rooms are lovely and new very clean and comfortable the mattress was to my taste short drive to the airport and very well located just a short walk from the promenade coffee shops restaurants the staff are so welcoming we felt like staying with family we would definitely stay again on our next visit to larnaca thank you so much for the great time we had with you
we wanted a hotel for a night that is close to the airport and this hotel did that purpose more than fair there are some restaurants and bars next to the beach just min of walking distance from the hotel the receptionist did not speak english properly and you have a feeling that people are living in the hotel rather than staying at a hotel you can hear the airplanes coming and leaving from the airport all the time so if you are sensitive to the sounds around you and at night better to skip this hotel and choose a different one
second visit chose really because it was reasonably close to the airport for an early morning flight yet could have a stroll along the nearby beach 
the staff make it particularly reception and the dining room nothing really though for a stay for more than a few days it is a bit on the edge of larnaca with frequent busses to the centre
i liked the rooms they are spacious clean the window view is nice too the restaurant downstairs is amazing the food there is very very tasty and made with a lot of care they care a lot about the details olive oil galore herbs absolutely delicious
the owner and staff were exceptionally friendly and supportive and helped with all our wishes our room had a balcony with great view of the sea and surrounding area
a family run hotel with extremely friendly reception and dining staff very bright nice seating areas inside and out meals well prepared and good value bus every minutes to the centre of larnaka nothing considering the price
close to airport
location clean friendly stuff
the hotel is impressive how clean nice and comfortable it is however what will bring me back is the staff and the owners richard the chef is personally buying super fresh food for the restaurant everything from breakfast to dinner is absolutely delicious the owners have been super kind to me
room was perfect looked new clean shiny tiled floors and bathroom tiles just every inch perfect and clean bed was really comfortable lots of room for me to put my things although might have needed another set of drawers if there were two of us fridge could have been put on beforehand so it was cold the shower took a while to get hot had to have a cold shower one morning as i needed to get out early when you left it running for around mins it got warm and was a good shower 
ordered pizza one night and was not great too stodgy but i am sure other food is better the restaurant area is nice and the staff very accomodating
the beds were very comfortable
i loved the mattress
clean and quiet
the hotel is minutes from the beach and the location is also near the lake 
the rooms are a good size and are laid out very well with a good size bathroom
the room also has a great sized balcony to take a tea coffee and 
chill
there is a great restaurant inside where the food is good and not to pricey 
the staff are super wonderful really friendly all of them the receptionist maria is so nice she is amazing 
keep up the great work leaving in fact just re booked the hotel for weeks time
so comfortable clean friendly staff perfect for overnight stay before flying from larnaca airport nothing
staff is very polite and caring thank you surrounding buildings are under construction and poorly lit
very clean functional rooms lovely and very helpful staff i would have liked an ironing board in the room
staff were lovely service was great the room was spotless great location for restaurants great location for a short drive to the airport not applicable
clean comfortable friendly staff great restaurant beneath the hotel food excellent reasonably priced very close to mackenzy beach larnaca airport we would definitely stay there again all good
the bed was great rooms clean staff were so kind nothing
very helpful staff super clean room with modern furniture all together make your stay max comfortable sure worth it to come back again 
option to have a good breakfast within the hotel save your time 
highly recommend these apartments little bit noisy during evening time from the street side i believe it does not disturb you in case you choose the garden view apartments or just close the windows and start the air conditioning
welcoming 
value for money 
location more hooks on walls for towels etc
there was a problem with heating water at that time and we can understand but eventually we could not manage to have a proper shower with hot water
when we arrived we were surprised at the location in a small side street but it was only a minute walk to the sea front the receptionist on check in was very good and explained the information very clearly to us the room was smaller than i expected but as we were only there a few days it was acceptable i am very fussy about beds and pillows but i had no problem as they were very clean and the bed was really comfortable 
the chef was very polite and his food was excellent he had passion and it showed in his presentation we may have missed it but there was no opening and closing times of the bar on display nothing except not showing opening times
really clean lovely caring staff food was good too nothing really the bus to the airport is close by and runs every minutes
great rooms nice and cool
it was really clean and spacious
nice location not far from airport and mackenzie beach my only real observation was that there was no net curtain or blind so one needed to ensure that the curtain was closed especially when going for a shower as the room is opposite some apartments that have a clear view into the room
super friendly and helpful staff a good location lins away from the airport by car mins walk to the beach clean modern rooms very nice breakfast it is typical of all restaurants in the area the kitchen shuts at or so and there is no food to be had afterwards i would just flag that ahead of time in the welcome email to those arriving from the uk most early afternoon flights land after and have something like nuts chips available to buy on arrival
hospitality clean
clean spacious practical
the facilities were really good particularly for the tariff charged was met with a warm welcome at reception and then again by the dining staff outside was a but noisy later in the evening but that is not within the hotels control
recently updated everything was me and clean restaurant was a surprise hit good food very reasonably priced so an easy choice to eat at the hotel when we would not usually the beach is about minutes walk away there is a bit of plane noise in the afternoon and evening because it is right near the takeoff end of the runway but next to no departures in the morning so not a problem
great value for money
very helpful staff who organised a taxi to collect us in the morning good value for money
clean and comfortable rooms lovely owner
great location close to the airport and a short walk to the sea great value for money the rooms were big enough for a family of
great little hotel close to airport not very soundproof
near airport nice clean room very well kept staff very helpful and friendly good food
everything was good nothing
nice renovated hotel close to the airport and mackenzie beach delicious breakfasts in the hotel restaurant comfortable bed
very nice and clean room
good for airport transfers a lot of mosquitos
perfect place to stay for early morning late night flights as it s situated within minutes from the airport 
beds are extremely comfortable and amazing hospitality from the staff given that a lot of guests book here for its prime location near the airport it would ve been great if breakfast started at rather than but that s just a suggestion everything was perfect
for one nights stay
very clean very comfortable room staff was extremely helpful they ordered a taxi for us to get to the airport very early in the morning we were able to enjoy a very nice short walk to the beach where there were many restaurants available to choose from we will definitely stay here again when we come back to larnaca
close to the airport the staff were nice and helpful the room was not soundproof so you can hear the planes
close to airport so very convenient for overnight stay also very easy to check in if you arrive late at night
arrived in the early hours clear instructions left access to our room made easy
excellent range of food offered and good service no issues for overnight stay
comfortable location near the airport and near the beach 
caring and helpful host 
restaurant on site
comfortable beds the best linen and duvets i had
 in my entire day trip 
in room mini bar tea coffee 
clean modern bathroom 
good ac we liked la veranda
our son had a folding bed which could have been better especially considering how comfortable the regular beds were
it s been renovated to a exceptionally high standard and it really is well up to standard exceptional value i cannot find a single negative point which is unusual having spent years travelling as part of work i am perhaps over critical
we were looking for the hotel close to the airport and it was a perfect match the hotel is located in a close proximity to the airport min by car or min by bus we arrived late and were super hungry so we decided to eat in the place at the ground floor even though the kitchen was closing they made us a pizza which was really nice the room was new and clean the staff reached out in advance and provided us with the detailed instructions of how to get to the room when reception closes if you are looking for a quiet stay you should be aware that the hotel is really close to the airport so you can hear all the noise from the planes
the property was clean bed was comfortable and the food and staff were really good location was great and easy to get to and from
the location was perfect for the airport as we were flying out to uk the entrance to the hotel is welcoming and the bar and coffee shop chic 
the gentleman in reception was very friendly and had a lovely smile 
the place was spotless and very comfortable 
i would definitely recommend it and will be staying here again 
the fish and steak restaurant around the corner was also great value and friendly
friendly staff nothing so far
friendly good value clean
the place and the people are lovely i could not ask for more during my stay especially with such a price
peaceful and clean friendly helpful staff nothing
we arrived after midnight got very clear instructions how to get access to our room the staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and nice 
the bus stop with direct access to the airport is a few steps from the accommodation the airport can be reached in a few minutes at the same time mackenzie beach is also easily accessible on foot there is no shop or pharmacy in the area but the accommodation cannot do anything about this overall we are extremely satisfied
i arrived late i received very clear instructions how to enter the hotel and access my room
lovely staff doing best to assist always wonderful room
the hotel is based on a quiet place near to the airport beach and the salt lake in the city the location is excellent as there are lots of parking places around as well regarding the rooms very clean and cozy ones with comfortable beds furthermore there is a restaurant in the hotel with delicious food the staff of the hotel is extremely friendly and nice

amazing staff 
super clean

great location
stuff was very nice and friendly room was clean and comfortable the location was a little bit far from the centre
the breakfast was very good plenty of selection and very good staff serving you as a values customer and so very polite and caring at all times could not seem to do enough for their guests every thing was spotless clean in the breakfast room the only thing was they did not a have pool but however had plenty of chairs to sot on outside in the garden which also was spotlessly clean everywhere too
good food in the restaurant downstairs friendly personnel the room was not clean when we checked in so they finished the cleaning after our complaint
lovely little hotel with very friendly staff breakfast was excellent

very nice rooms that were very clean 
helpful friendly staff
we did late night check in that was super easy and comfortable it was a bit badly soundproofed
new room very comfortable nice restaurant in the same building very welcoming with nice offer bus stop for the airport walkable 
francais parl parfaitement the location of the place is more a waiting position for your next flight at the larnaka airport than a beach stay
the best hotel at mackenzie amazing staff modern facility and very tasty food with a super service at the restaurant by the hotel
clean and quiet perfect location for the airport
the staff is very nice the room is very comfortable some of the towels were dirty
the food we had was excellent service was excellent we will go back
we used the hotel only for one night because it is close to the airport but i must admit the location offers some nice places for at least a two nights stay for sure the nearby beach mackenzie is nice long with some cool and fancy bars there is also the salt lake which i wished to visit but did not have time the hotel itself was very nice spacious clean and modern only thing i did not like were the blankets too thick for this incredible hot hot hot weather
very clean and the staff was wonderful
really clean exceptional staff incredibly polite highly recommend
the staff were very hospitable and very helpful the cupboards wardrobes need doors and they should be drawers in the room to keep the rooms tidy
nice modern and clean rooms the location is excellent close to airport makenzie beach and touristic area and bus stop going from airport to town is few meters away very friendly staff 
highly recommended nothing
the room was recently refurbished and very spatious nice view of the salt lake by the terrace 
sinks and toilette separated by a door inside the bathroom no soap or shampoo in the shower there was hand soap instead
quiet place good rooms
we only stayed for a night but we were super happy with our stay at the la veranda hotel the staff was super nice the rooms were very clean and the bathroom was spacious i liked everything about the property
we used the accommodation for one night before departure the advantage is the proximity to the airport very comfortable beds the hotel staff should learn better english confusing the term fridge and freezer can be fatal for a person with diabetes the team froze our insulin meaning it was unusable luckily we flew home the next day if it happened before the holidays we have got the entertainment covered
rooms large and newly redecorated in a contemporary style bed very comfortable very convenient for the airport breakfast was excellent nothing
everything nothing
clean hotel lovely rooms with comfortable beds great location for overnight stay for late flights very helpful staff
i went there while on transit in larnaca the building is completely refurbished it is confortable and the self check in was very easy
spotlessly clean excellent for airport and mackenzie beach nothing
recently refurbished very nice restaurant good food and service
everything was very good staff very polite and helpful rooms are clean breakfast was delicious hotel is near to the beach airport and bus station
i really enjoyed this place it did not have a pool but it was minutes from the airport by taxi by shuttle bus there are also connecting buses from ayia napa to this hotel via larnaca which we used for our early morning start from larnaca airport mckenzie beach is close by and the food restaurants off the opposite beach were only a ten minute walk 
air con and fridge in rooms with a bottle of water provided 
perfect for our short stay and the hotel was immaculately clean i was particularly impressed when the staff emailed me via booking com and after asking me what time i was arriving the hotel is not manned but arrangements are made to collect your room key in the hotel if you are arriving outside of normal hours told me which bus routes i needed to take 
very impressed however anything longer than a night stay and you may get a little bored 
highly recommended i have no complaints
stuff in the hotel were very helpful and nice my stay in la veranda was perfect mackenzie beach is few minutes airport near best location in larnaca
clean air conditioned close to the airport
the location next to the airport is great for flights very early in the morning because it only takes you minutes to get to the airport 
the beach is a minutes walk away
location near the airport and beach 
front desk are absolutely perfect 
hotel restaurant delicious 
the room perfect 
nothing to say
the room was clean and comfortable with everything i needed including a fridge and kettle the shower was great the air con worked well it is in a great location for the airport and the beach but what made la veranda stand out was the fantastic service they could not have been friendlier kinder or more helpful and it made a massive difference for me as they were able to accommodate my specific needs for which i was extremely grateful i liked everything
helpful staff and close to airport the room was small but adequate
super clean
 decent sized rooms
 new rooms flat tv touch buttons for cleaning etc generally nothing was old no hair shampoo and in general only the basic amenities
very clean and super friendly staff would recommend nothing
nice and simple hotel very convenient location close to the airport the front desk was very friendly and helpful the area was a little noisy when we stayed there
very friendly staff
the best stars hotel i have been ever clean as hospital super comfy close to one of the best beaches of larnaca region perfectly connect by public transport with larnaca city centre all that with quite reasonable price taxi drivers who cooperate with hotel both times from airport and back charged eur above the price agreed with the hotel eur to clarify it is not about the money i would certainly give that money as a tip but feeling that someone is cheating you and stilling money from you is really awkward and ugly especially when you are alone with small child in the middle of the night and have no alternative way of transport
the food was very tasty i did not have breakfast but ate dinner at the restaurant staff very helpful and friendly very nice bathroom and the room was well equipped and also smelled very nice it was a bit loud outside but that was just normal for summertime i guess

all in all the stau at the hotel was a wonderful experience
very nice place just few steps from the salt lake and the mckenzie beach with shallow water good for people who are not too good swimmers a lot of cafes and bars nearby the staff was very welcoming as well another plus is the electronic system for saying if you want to clean up your room or you do not want to be disturbed it was not a big issues when i came but the hotel does not have it is own parking lot so sometimes it might be difficult to find a parking spot
personal was friendly everything was clean nice place

lovely
it was clean and modern ideal for our large family
conveniently located a very modern and contemporary hotel excellent breakfast we had a very late am self check in which worked very well our room was rather small and lacked a balcony which can make a lot of difference we had one on our previous stay
very clean and beside the airport
staff was amazing location and cleanliness
room clean and spacious staff very helpful excellent location for beach and airport transfer
good location friendly people good a c
clean spacious friendly new and modern not too close to the beach 
perfect for pre or post airport stays
the mattresses were hard 
 when we were booking the room there was a promotion from booking com which did not apply and we payed euro more after that i checked a new dates to book and we had similar number and if we do it it will be the same this is a big fraud
perfect if you want to stay close to the airport 
mackenzy beach with restaurants is not that far away
everything was exactly as promised clean and well organized the staff were so friendly that we really felt we are at home with our relatives the food at the restaurant was amazing richard as the head of hotel's restaurant cooks with passion and almost everything from scratch so fresh and good looking he makes a simple breakfast amazing and his lunch table looks like a feast

the wonderful staff at this place makes all the difference i only stayed for night but would absolutely stay again

i arrived late at night the hotell organised a taxi for me and made sure i could check in
clean and simple
the room is very cleanthe bed is comfortable the facilities are new i like this hotel
very nice everything
nice clean room comfortable bed and good location nothing it was all good
very clean room comfy beds very nice showers all freshly renovated nothing it is sometimes a bit noisy because of the air traffic
excellent communication on late check in process airy and comfortable room super fast wifi and a tip this hotel is only km from the airport if travelling light you can walk it in minutes saving a rip off cab fare just off the before highway tv very light on choice only news channel in english
this was only a one night stay before moving onto our holiday accommodation for the rest of the week we arrived later than planned due to flight issues but the owner was aware as he had tracked our flight despite being late we were offered food and drink in the bar which was most welcome the room was clean and an adequate size with a nice balcony breakfast was outstanding the staff were all friendly and welcoming especially the restaurant owner we could not turn on the mini fridge to cool our water bottles overnight ready for the following day it was very late to go and ask so we did not probably something to show guests initially
its was a nice place clean and the room was nice
the indications at the desk were very helpful
very good staff very friendly and very helpful very comfortable nights sleep no complaints about the hotel parking in the area is always possible but not necessarily the most convenient
everything nothing
excellent staff in this family driven hotel very helpful and pleasant people who speak perfect english and could not have been better all the way from the booking process and online dialog to putting us on a taxi to the airport this alone is reason enough to come back 
rooms and hotel in general are very clean aircon modern and quiet and room service is also excellent 
plenty of electricity outlets in the room also by the bed but remember the uk adapter to use standard eu plugs 
the double bed although nothing fancy was probably the best hotel bed we have slept in ever except excellent staff owners and an ok restaurant there is not much extra in this hotel or in the room 
tips for improvement 
 the out of order pool table hidden away in the backyard should be brought back to life 
 the backyard itself could actually have been used so much better 
 the small fridge in the room was warm turned off upon arrival and completely empty and no local shop kiosk nearby to fill it up one small bottle of water upon arrival to double room feels a little poor would gladly have paid those more per day to have bottles initially and being refilled daily with room service a couple of cents more to have even tea on the small welcome tray 
 bathroom floor gets completely wet when carefully showering as only half a glass wall covers the shower 
 bed frame has very sharp hard corners and it is easy to get hurt apply baby safety corners 
 veranda door and main door does not close entirely tight so main door slams in the night when it is windy however fixable in macgyver way using the bed cover and a tea spoon although a professional seal attached to the door frame would probably be a better fix long term 
 beach towel services would also have been nice and useful to avoid using lots of space weight in baggage 
all in all this hotel is great but still has room for improvement in many little details which could easily be fixed still getting our high rating as the staff is simply the best and made our stay a true pleasure thus above comments should not scare anyone from booking this hotel we highly recommend it and would definitely love to return
very clean and fresh perfect room for family close to airport very kind hosts made late check in simple
the cyprus hospitality at the highest level feel at home in minute with owners welcoming you with a big smile 
the location is convenient and the room had a big balcony hospitality location quiet
exceptionally friendly service of hotel and restarant in same building attention and service superb
location clean and very good value all was good nothing bad to say
very friendly staff rooms were clean and ideally situated for the airport
great location for a late flight everything was clean and nice in the room we arrived late and got great instructions on how to get in on our own terrific late breakfast at the caf downstairs the manager catered to our every need nothing great for the price and our purpose of a late night flight arrival
beautiful property super clean rooms where really spacious and fresh and clean breakfast was amazing in a beautiful setting and the management are wonderful liked everything a little far from local shop but have everything we need in the cafe
great location for bars restaurants and beach at a very good rate for the excellent standard of accommodation nothing all good
great location with very welcoming staff and very clean
modern hotel with good facilities although small the room was comfortable however the bathroom was a good size and well appointed breakfast as an extra was good 
the hotel is about m from the bus route which runs to the airport about minutes away a ticket costs euros a far better option than paying euros for a taxi nothing
clean and comfortable
close to the airport stingy smell from the bathroom
quite small room
light and airy and clean room not far from the sea there should be a safety strip on the step to each floor coming up the stairs you are unaware of it and could possibly trip as i did
thank you so much for a very warm welcome and comfortable stay the hotel manager was reachable at all times due to my flight times and further delays i could not have asked for more informative and reassuring service star service 
the location is very nice of this hotel due to such close proximity to the beach and restaurants 
most importantly it is very clean all in all awesome nothing
spacious room and minifridge large bathroom very clean and comfy bed and lovely little balcony staff was very friendly and lend me an adaptor several times 
i did not want to be in the center so for me the location was perfect walking distance to airport and close to the more luxurious beach strip with delicious restaurants for the price that it was it only had some random unlabeled shampoo dispenser attached to the shower wall do not know if it was body or hair shampoo but it was not very nice at all and seemed a little cheap considering the hotel cost
very clean comfortable and pleasant the staff were very accommodating and kind we will definitely come again highly recommended nothing
very modern clean beautifully kept hotel near beaches and restaurants all good

we booked this hotel last minute and we were extremely happy with the service they have great staff are very welcoming and the restaurant at floor level is awesome richard is a great chef and his friendliness will make you want to extend your vacation for sure we felt like we were part of their community and this is due to their opennes the room was extremely clean and their room service makes sure to keep it this way all in all the best experience we could have asked for nothing we can think of
the owners were very friendly and helpful the hotel is small which we liked and is about minutes from the airport the rooms were a nice size very clean and modern we had both a family room and a double room and they were perfect for our quick stay the taxi driver had a hard time finding it to drop us off as it s amongst several apartment buildings on a small side street that s the only negative we also had dinner there and the food was very good and the chef was very friendly we ll stay again if we travel to larnaca in the future the location is a bit hard to find the taxi drivers gps had trouble finding it but eventually we did it s amongst several apartment buildings on a small side street
cleanliness very good location

the hotel is in a residential neighborhood of apartments and is modern the bed linens were wonderful and the mattress was neither too hard or soft breakfast is not included in the hotel cost however there is small restaurant within the hotel lobby that charged euros for a very nice hot breakfast no menu you get whatever is served the hotel is approx minute drive from the airport and minute drive from the historical area
very smart modern rooms and everything you need family feel and very friendly having a family suite was a big bonus and lots of space immediate location wasn t inspiring but lovely restaurants very close in the sea front and handy for limassol and airport

very clean nice bed and linen 
good value 
allowed to take dog was the reason for booking some smell from bathroom water
boutique hotel in the quiet area staff was friendly and helpful only few kilometers from the airport but quite distant from the city center on the other hand close to salt lake to have opportunity to watch flamings good tasty breakfest
a nice and clean boutique hotel close to airport and makenzie beach area taxi fare to airport around euro the room does not maintain well noise insulation but this is typical in the area
staff were happy to go above and beyond to help me with covid restrictions for the airport which was very close by i actually had a couple of issues that would have made it hard for me to travel had it not been for the staff the breakfast was good the room and location were excellent value for money i was also upgraded a room free of charge i suspect because the hotel was quite empty lovely balcony view of the ocean

what i liked most about the hotel is the room bed sheets and toilet are super clean bed is very comfortable on top of that the hotel is less than a minute away on foot from the bus station 
the city is nice a lot of restaurants bars and shops in the area and of course lots and lots of beach shores to relax at one of which you can get on foot for less than minutes 
the staff was nice they gave me recommendations on what places to visit and how to roam around the weather was a bit cold
first off the staff they have been so accommodating and easy to deal with and have gone above and beyond to help us out we had a delayed flight that landed hours late and when we arrived all the restaurants were closed richard was amazing and whipped us up an excellent pizza even though they were long since closed

i stayed for one night as i arrived late at night at larnaca airport and was going to another city limassol the next day the receptionist was waiting for me to arrive even though it was after the usual open hours the room was very clean a bit small though but the bathroom was spacious and the bed was comfortable
location room
well organised and clean
excellent everything we got there early around am and they had our room ready the place was clean spacious and really nice it was a pleasant walk to the sea but there was not much else to do close by more restaurants
i stayed in this hotel twice because of the location to the airport but i found it be clean modern comfortable and great value for money it is a minute walk to makenzie beach and those restaurants but it also has a nice patio restaurant for a meal or cocktail the rooms are a bit small but they have nice amenities fridge coffee making ac nice balcony and are spotless and comfortable the staff is nice and it is very welcoming location if you want to be in the center of everything i did not
room was excellent very clean and everything seems fairly new staff was very helpful location is also very good if you have a morning flight airport is a min drive away the noise from the hallway was very loud the doors are not sound proofed at all and we could not sleep because of the noise that was coming around am
nice small hotel not far from the airport 
everything was good clean and fresh rooms good hosts and min walk to the beach smell from the lake but it doesn t depend on the hotel
clean and freshly renovated room
this hotel was perfect for us because we arrived late at night with the intention to get some rest before we continued our journey it s location was ideal for the purpose of our stay because it s close to the larnaca airport the host of the hotel was so kind and helpful always a smile on his face with great energy and amazing hospitality making sure we had a great stay i would rate him for sure
everything was very clean the bed was comfortable spacious bathroom the beach is very close and the bus to the airport is only meters away the room was a bit cramped but we could fit it may have been a unique case but a rather disturbing odor of sewage came out of the drains the smell could be felt on the street that day as well
small and quiet
the staff was exceptional they were really customer centric and kind the breakfast was really delicious too nothing it was perfect
clean fresh nice and peaceful 
very welcoming all spot on
the staff was super nice 
we needed a taxi for the airport and they have helped us book it for a really good price better than everything we have seen online the room was really clean and the bed was comfortable the wifi in the room was not great we had to work that day so we needed a strong wifi but there is a cafe nero minutes away which was perfect

excellent hotel clean and with excellent owners nothing
the family running this hotel are very friendly and welcoming they gave us a free room upgrade the building and the hotel are brand new spotlessly clean walking distance to the beach restaurants and shops it is away from traffic fully stocked minibar with coffee and tea making facilities value for money we will stay again 
tip if you like sleeping in the dark bring a sleeping mask and or some blu tack to secure the curtains in place on the th floor with all the windows and balcony doors locked we could still hear some outside noise
it s definitely one of the best accommodations i ve ever been in everything was just good 
clean rooms cleaning every day 
great staff and very pleasant hosts 
strong wi fi at any time 
very friendly and comfortable atmosphere 
garnish restaurant on the ground is amazing the owner is a very kind person and creative chef i ll miss his breakfasts 
in other words i ll stay here my next time in larnaca for sure no such thing
very good value for money the room was nice with a big balcony a bit farther away than most hotels so it is a bit of a trek to get to get to the busier beach and bars but the area its in is good for water sports and is where the quieter beaches are
i stay in larnaca every year but this was my first time at la veranda and i d recommend the owners were absolutely lovely and made sure we had everything we needed property was clean and modern and location was good
extremely friendly people work at la veranda they helped us in any possible way thank you
great friendly staff very welcoming the owner took me personally to our room and gave me a prime parking spot

could not have been more pleased all good
great location min walk to beach and amenities staff very good and helpful rooms were comfortable snd very clean notting
very modern and clean
clean and good communication booked a taxi from the airport was a no show
we picked up our hire care from the airport and within minutes we had arrived a family run hotel exceptional staff who were so friendly and keen to please rooms were also exceptional in their cleanliness and although compact had everything that you might need for your stay i rarely write reviews but this place deserves to do well also only minutes walk from beach and loads of restaurants i was happy with everything
staff and owners were very welcoming breakfast was a typical cypriot one not much parking around the property which was an apartment before being converted into this hotel the inside is excellent compared to the view from outside aircraft noise does not bother me but the noise from aircraft landing and taking off may be an issue if you have young family or just want a quiet area

we ve chosen la veranda as we had an early flight from larnaka airport and we enjoyed one night stay there is a beach strip nearby with various restaurants for every taste we walked there had cocktails in one place and a dinner in another breakfast in the hotel was great and we were in the airport in no time at all nothing to complain about

staff excellent and accommodating very nice clean rooms
friendly staff nice room with comfortable beds and nice bathroom good choice for travelers in larnaca
clean and perfect location nothing
location and staff
the food was amazing at the restaurant mostly the bathroom floor sink was closed with tapes and there was bugs under it but i think it was a special case and do not think that all hotel rooms has the same issue
extremely clean newly renovated efficiently run good location from the airport and sea nothing
people working here are the best ever wifi
bright cozy looks like almost new hotel in silent part of town very helpful staff minutes drive from the airport walk to the city center about meters to the nice beach tv with only channels but that was not a big problem
i stayed for a couple of nights so that i could quickly get to the airport cozy clean hotel with wonderful staff can also enjoy delicious breakfast if desired nice place recommend
location is great rooms were a great size very clean modern and comfy pool could of been bigger but you re right next to an amazing beach mckenzie beach so it didn t matter
richard is the chef at the hotel the food he creates is outstanding and delicious even the simplest of food ie chicken burger and salad was made to taste exceptional whether you stay at the hotel or not you should go to their restaurant for lunch or dinner or both it will not disappoint and you will want to keep going back richard cooks from the heart 
overall the hotel is well situated the rooms are stylish and the beds very comfortable the staff are helpful and friendly 
this was my first stay at the hotel and i would gladly stay again i highly recommend it
it was very clean very comfortable easily a star hotel very welcoming minute walk to the beach the chef is incredible and very friendly the kind of person who loves nothing more than you enjoying his food

the room was clean the hotel facilitated shuttle service from the airport for an additional cost based on my request the hotel also very kindly received a package on my behalf prior to my arrival maha was responsive and reachable via whatsap and was able to accommodate the needs for my stay the hotel is good for a layover in larnaca as it is close to the airport and also allows you access to the beach at min walking distance

the owners tony and joanna were very friendly welcoming and accommodating as was richard at the bar restaurant coming off of a us based cruise ship we had forgotten converters to charge our phones but tony had multiple for us to borrow he even had a luggage scale for us as we prepared our suitcases for our departure back home 
the rooms were completely renovated and stunning with brand new air conditioning systems that chilled the rooms within minutes we rented a bedroom suite 
finally the place was spotlessly clean there is nothing negative to say about the property it was a wonderful stay n
the rooms and and the staff nothing
very friendly and effective employees and owners 
brand new fittings and furniture 
excellent location near the airport and the beach 
very clean and quite 
i recommend it without any reservation nothing at all
great location convenient to the airport and the beach professional and friendly staff if you are looking to an affordable clean hotel minutes away from the airport and within walking distance to the beach restaurants and other amenities this is the place for you nothing
very good service
it is recently renovated building therefore the rooms were nice and clean mackenzie beach promenade is min walk close surroundings are not that exciting and clean
everything was perfect 
nice location excellent rooms very friendly staff
very clean modern good customer service and restaurant bar very reasonably priced and quality
check in was quick and easy by polite friendly hotel managers great service by richard bar manager rooms very clean good quality bed linen and towels a c flat screen tv

amazing place to be honest everything was perfect
very clean nice renovated rooms staff was fantastic and price was great need some renovation in lobby and common areas as well as for the elevator 
during night lights in common areas did not work well
everything was excellent
very modern and clean netflix in room an unexpected surprise but beware difficult to sign back out of your account no views but a short walk to nice beach bars rebuke is v good close to airport room small but i had the smallest i think
amazing staff i met the owners at the reception and they took care of my girl and she was very happy with her stay and the room was clean and ready by to check in nothing
we liked a lot the hotel it is location and services but the most we liked the personnel especially the chief he is real professional was always trying to prepare for us traditional vegan dishes of local cuisine always delicious more over he was very friendly and kind hearted to us recommending places of interest routes e t c thanks to cyprus thanks to la veranda thanks to the chief it would be great to have a clothes dryer at the balcony or in the bathroom because after the swimming nowhere to dry the wet clothes and towels 
 after the room cleaning most hotels provide a bottle of water it is not expensive for the hotel but it is demonstrating the care about the clients we had one bottle only after check in and none for the rest nights
the room was fresh and clean friendly staff highly recommended
amazing stay near mackenzie beach just min walk the staff is superb clean and spacious rooms will definitely come back again much recommended
very good team
good hospitality
good food
smiling and willing people
all was good a bit small rooms
perfect play renovated to relax the owners mum children from lebanon are very kind and ready to help even they invite you to sit with them and relax with a drink at night the rooms are brand new very good bedding 
furthermore i can speak about richard the chef of the hotel he makes you feel like you know each other years before he is kind polite ready to help you with whatever you want to eat and drink delicious food and facilities keep going guys and for sure is my favourite place for holidays nothing
new hotel so everything is modern and clean and good bed linen furniture 
 minutes walk to makkenzy beach with planes landing just above you 
staff is very polite and friendly
 minutes walk to city center minutes bus drive the lock on the balcony's door was broken however they sayd we repaired it when i asked it was not done the lock was not closing as it should 
i see it as a problem because with the door unlocked theoretically anyone could open the door from the balcony and the noise from the street was entering to my room through the crack 
i almost broke the showers door because when you open the shower the door touches the toilet
nice modern bedroom nice greek breakfast and hotel great location shame i only stayed one night
a wonderful place run by wonderful people
this hotel was excellent and exceeded all my expectations the restaurant had delicious food the service was incredible rooms were to a very high standard and clean i am very pleased to stay here and grateful for the staff they have been helpful kind and professional i highly recommend this hotel
if i could give more than a rating of i would 
the location is amazing being close to the airport in larnaka makes travelling easier also being right next to the salt lake is a must see especially if there is a good sunset 
within a minute walk you can be on mackenzie beach which is well maintained and cleaner than other beaches we seen in larnaka rebuke lounge at the beach is worth visiting for the quality of food and decor 
the hotel is next to a bus stop for travelling between downtown and other locations very handy since we didn t hire a car 
the staff make this hotel great they are friendly warm helpful always willing to do more to make the guest have a better stay 
the recently renovated room is about as clean as it could be the facilities are modern and new the shower is amazing for couples to use together the balcony is a nice addition to an already fresh well presented room 
the double bed is extremely comfortable and the new bedding was a delight it is hard to get a comfortable sheet to sleep with in a country as warm as cyprus but we were happy with everything offered by the hotel 
the minibar was extremely reasonably priced and well stocked 
aircon perfect easy to use 
wifi great when we used it 
we didn t take advantage of the pool in the hotel only because we ran out of time but on another trip we would have done so 
the front of the hotel is an extremely nice place to unwind in the evening minor point a bar for hanging clothes in the room was the only thing we felt was missing to improve our stay
perfect
superbly refurbished with high tech displays clean dnd outside taller people be careful of doorway leading to elevator being i head bumped
the bed the customer service
great staff very clean and modern rooms great value
walking distance from the mackenzie beach beach lounges and restaurants the hotel and room were super clean the staff were really welcoming and breakfast was awesome would definitely book again upon my next visitz
we liked everything the staff and hosts were great quiet place pet friendly will visit again for sure value for money just an amazing place
close to airport just min by taxi clean fresh rooms with all you need for overnight stay very friendly staff the bottle with hair body wash was empty aircon had just one uncontrolled speed there were no adapters for cy sockets the blanket was too warm for summer night
very nice and kind stuff breakfast was tasty and excellent
everything very friendly and helpful staff comfortable rooms great location highly recommend nothing
a little bit far from sea
my stay was fantastic steps to makenzy beach caf s and restaurants easy access to nightlife the building is very clean and made for a comfortable stay the staff made me feel welcome and was very helpful when asking about things to do definitely will be back i wish i stayed longer
this hotel is very new and completely renovated it s spotless clean comfortable and very good service from the family that owns it 
we felt very welcome the room is completely new and very clean the mini bar was really well equipped and very cheap free parking close to the city and very accessible by any transportation
i had a wonderful experience at la veranda hotel staff was amazing and very welcoming rooms are so clean and comfortable with variety of snacks at very affordable price walking distance from the beach and very easy access to public transportation nothing
family room that fits a family of five fantastic breakfast close to jogging trails along the lake and close to the airport plus a super friendly staff
the room sizes were excellent for the wheelchair 
the hotel was airy and light 
the hotel was nice and very clean it was the reason why i booked the reviews 
it was great accessibility to where we wanted to be the breakfast could have had more variety they had no cereal on offer at all they had no ordinary tea on offer it was al earl grey no proper plan tea 
this hotel is accessible to wheelchairs but there ramps are not to eu regulations very steep they really need to sort this the ramp right outside is very dangerous i am surprised i was not wheeled of this ramp i think booking com should investigate this
i did not eat at hotel comfortable bed lovely soft duvet and pillows good shower times noise in week a m from people picking rubbish into large lorries
spotlessly clean and the staff were so helpful it was not on the beach front as we were under the impression it was
very clean not enough pillows
quiet location bed was very soft and uncomfortable for me 
parking was very limited
everything was pretty good and as expected windows should be closed as the front building looks right into your room
the room was large and had a nice balcony the bus stop into town was around the corner there was nothing close by for a mini mart the restaurant was decent
clean and comfortable cute balconies short walk to mckenzie beach street parking
i really liked how polite and friendly the staff was and i also liked the size of the room an the bed there are various things i would love to see improved listed here 
 the shower of our room is very inconviniently placed making a mess because of insufficient coverage of the bathroom glass
 the edges of the shower between wall tiles and the shower floor need replacement they are hollow and seem moldy
 the bin is rusty
 the mirror is weirdly placed on the right of the sink
 due to the placement of the curtains a lot of light gets in the room in the morning
 there is no designated parking you just park wherever you find
 we have requested late check out pm which we got and we appreciate it however we got a call that prompted us to check out at the normal time pm as the next customers would arrive i exllained thay we have been granted late check out and the clerk apologised no problem for this but i find it important to keep staff updated about these things
near to the airport there was some kind of unpleasant smell in the bathroom
close to the airports this is a guesthouse that is priced like a hotel
maria and richard are really great hosts very kind and hospitable maria has offered an adapter immediately 
the room was perfectly clean 
this is a good transitioning for one night like i had or just to sleep over 
central location size of the room is one of the smallest i have ever seen there is no space for the suitcase nor a wardrobe no sitting area 
there is a terrace which sun hits all the time except for the early morning 
for that money for which i used to pay better hotels in valencia you get one small water bottle
it was clean the beds were comfortable for what you get it was a bit expensive the rooms were a bit small for a suite no breakfast included we tried it one time at their restaurant and it was low quality compared to an original greek breakfast did not eat there again
very friendly people 
very spacious and clean room 
very close to the larnaka airport as we needed it to be the duvet was for the winter and even with degrees celsius on the a c it was unbearable 
no simple sheets on the bed either 
our only other choice was to close the a c an go without covers but we could not open the windows because it was very very noisy 
also the windows had no soundproofing whatsoever because the noise was too much 
we gave the duvet a chance up to am and then got up and opened the windows when the noise went down we had to leave to catch a flight at am not a good night's sleep 
also the room had a hair dryer and a kettle that we could not use because the plugs did not fit the sockets and the hotel did not provide adaptors so no use of that service in the room either
usefully located hotel in between city centre and airport restaurant stayed open reasonably late so i could eat after an evening arrival in cyprus restaurant was offering a rather narrow set of choices compared to what was listed on the menu room quite small
friendly staff 
very modern rooms bath room was cleaned rather superficially so that medium nice with hair not being removed
break fast was perfect the room was perfect some issues with internet and location bit far from the center but very quite area around cold floor in the room
breakfast was very filling it was located on the table in front of us funny question room was a little cold the hotel hadn t yet opened up for the season it was a little hard to find
clean room friendly staff off season so no bar restaurant pool which was not clear on booking
nice and very clean that they couldn t wait for min as i had just fractured my ankle and need to change my bandage and the lady of the house was literally standing next to the door with a cleaner to clean the room so i left without changing my bandage and had to do it outside on the street
nice clean little hotel next to the airport breakfast was below average
location very good did not have breakfast but the evening meal was poor as it is not really a bar or a restaurant
the staff were lovely the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable and the telly was not working properly
clean room good location for makenzie beach comfortable bed
staff was excellent complimentary coffee tea in our bedroom was not replenished after the first night only one coffee sachet for a double room 
whatever was used from the fridge was also not replenished 
there were no thin curtains to allow for some light to come through into the bedroom and so you had to draw the thick curtains if you wanted privacy
close to the airport we booked a taxi at in the morning to go to the airport very frustrating that the host did not inform us that his taxi had a double booking instead of ordening another for us
friendly and helpful staff 
 room cleanliness
property is perfectly located close from the airport and close to the famous makenzie beach neat and modern hotel facility property feels cold without an warm inviting atmosphere as it s to minimalistic rooms are a nice size but is unfortunately situated on top of the outside bar area twin beds are provided and the pillows is not comfortable at all the shower in the bathroom is open in front which results in the whole floor being wet property have a great potential with some care
chose this hotel because of it s proximity to airport one nights stay straight from the flight before travelling onwards next morning to other areas easy to find car hire using google maps friendly welcoming staff easy check in the hotel itself is spotlessly clean covid prevention measures taken never ate there cold beers available needed from bar downstairs or mini bar in room very quiet neighbourhood not sure what s nearby etc as up away early next morning would certainly recommend for this type of trip will probably use again next time nothing to report
close to mackenzie beach safe didn t work back door balcony in other bedroom wouldn t lock do not disturb sign didn t work electronic 
asked for double bed and got two single beds next to eachother 
very noisy guests waited minutes for someone to come greet us for check in no one on desk 
guy on desk told us we had not paid but we did 
then he took a picture of my passport which no hotel does at all which was very strange
very noisy neighborhood
it s clean you can easily pass here one night before flying back the location was not great the pool not even to be considered the overall hotel installation is badly maintained it s in front of a pension and so close that people could see the colour of my underwear 
the aircon was too strong so we d opened the windows big mistake very noisy i ve asked quiet room 
the lift broke the guy was offended becawe asked to see the room before paying 
the pictures of the room are accurate but fot the hotel installation and pool have a look to pasithea apartments
location is good and rooms are very well maintained convenient by taxi to city center airport and beach 
 peaceful and good for couples and backpackers the sandwiches and hummus by the chef were delicious 
 mrs tony does a fabulous job keeping the place spotless and making the guests comfortable the helps are amazing too 
thanks to all at the hotel who work hard to keep it in good condition no free breakfast option 
 however when i booked this property in advance it was a higher price but booking com reduced the price before my travel date and the hotel refused to accept the lower price which i felt was unfair for me as they charged twice for cancellation and rebooking maybe this was a booking com issue or the hotel but i was quite unhappy about this since it was not justified by the owner i spoke to ali from booking com and he said there was no cancellation charge but they charged me
 they need to put a lock to the bathroom and a shower glass door inside or else it gets messy 
 wifi is not good
i like the quietness and it s close to airport the way room are furnished is not comfortable
basic night stay but facilities are limited noisy
limited food options
probably renovation work was in progress so some items were not ready example there is no rod for hangers in the wardrobe the safe wasn t fixed
very comfortable bed room very new and comfortable tv did not work garbage truck passes at a m with an incredible noise
location was excellent and staff was very polite room was very clean upon arrival rate was very expensive for what it offered no cleaning service the days i stayed no emptying garbage can and also had to ask for fresh towels there were not even hangers for clothes in the closet
the people working there were kind and responsive our plumbing had complications twice moreover the cleaning crew cleaned out our rooms and threw out a box of cookies next to our bags that was meant to be a gift these cookies are only made in thessaloniki and cost us euros when we asked if they had seem them the owners brought them out of the trash room and offered to spray them as if that would be acceptable for an edible gift during covid pandemic cautions it was nice that they tried but they should be refunding us for the cookies we lost i feel bad writing a negative review because they were kind however only things near the garbage should be thrown out not stuff next to guests' belongings i was extremely disappointed in how they dealt with the situation and that they thought it was acceptable to take an edible gift out of a trash room and continue as if nothing happened
excellent location clean and modern
cleanliness
the room was nice and clean the two beds were set up as we requested there wasn t a fan in the bathroom so opening the window was required
room fresh clean and modern same as shown in photos 
calm area close to the beach many restaurants and coffee shops there 
bus station very close 
breakfast above expectations nothing
hotel is very close to the airport nice place to stay if you arrive late at night
liked the happy and smiling welcome that greets you once you arrive at the property unfortunately i did not have time to try their breakfasts as i had an early flight but they looked amazing i will definitely return and i can thoroughly recommend this property thank you very much not applicable
nice staff room very nice and clean swimming pool could be cleaner
very helpful and knowledgeable staff rooms are updated and clean
nice and clean perfect for an overnight stay owners very nice and friendly

very friendly atmosphere a family business where you feel like at home huge and delicious breakfast the hotel is very comfortable we definitely will come again
friendly staff and service very nice rooms clean
clean smart devices overpriced for its facilities if you are lucky you may have the only one parking in the side 
very poor lunch breakfast
nice the floor is not cleaned enough full of dust water does not drain and floods the room
the hotel is located close to the airport there is a bus with good frequency from the street next to the airport and close to the city center the hotel is located in a dead end and quiet street we had plenty of parking the rooms were very clean the staff at the hotel tony was nice and gave a pleasant feeling immediately after the booking we received a whatsapp from him to confirm the time of arrival and to inform that they were waiting for us
the kindness of the staff the size of the room location
the kindness of the staff the location the cleanliness of the room
friendly clean hotel functionally furnished balcony with courtyard or street view good breakfast directly in the hotel to be paid separately various options up to eur very friendly host proximity to the airport km and the beach including numerous restaurants m
french speaking and competent staff nothing
the cleanest place i stayed in cyprus 
the staff is kind and welcoming the waze is to blame for what i did not like 
she was less helpful in guiding me than the locals who explained to me in a second
pleasant accommodation helpful reception cleanliness the rooms were not soundproofed enough
the staff are extremely friendly and always happy to help when needed they were always ready to answer any of our questions in a very good location close to the airport especially if you have an early or late flight and also close to the beach the main reason for not giving the highest rating is the noise from the neighboring hotels houses they showered at any time of the day and made unpleasant noise there were problems with the sealing and closing of the window
nice room very clean 
convenient because close to the airport 
very kind and helpful staff 
we had dinner in the evening it was very good just a bit far from town
room a bit small
very kind staff delicious food impeccable cleanliness 
thank you
the room was very clean and very spacious 
the mattresses and pillows were excellent the only thing that was slightly flawed was the water in the shower in the evening which was lukewarm
pleasant staff
everything was great
nice and comfortable small room early november good availability of free parking spaces at the bottom of the hotel the beach is minutes walk the airport minutes by bus friendly staff and very good advice
proximity to the airport and excellent cuisine nothing
practical rooms balconies in each room good location for the airport listening staff the noise the rooms are poorly soundproofed we hear the neighbors moving
hotel near the airport ideal for a late arrival or a very early departure bed duvet much too thick we suffocate underneath very hard bed
noisy due to the heavy use of tiling and the steady stream of travelers arriving departing for the airport throughout the night 
do not use this hotel other than for a stopover night near the airport
wonderful hotel and staff all as in the photo
very good accommodation in a perfect location minutes from the airport
great location minutes by bus from and to the airport minutes walk to the beach and cafes by the beach it takes minutes to walk along the promenade to the city but it is nice the hotel is good the staff is friendly
great location close to the airport friendly service and delicious breakfasts
we only stayed at the laveranda hotel for one night as the end of our cyprus trip to be as close to the airport as possible for the last night it was perfect for that the room was very nicely furnished and above all super clean the bus connection to the city center was just around the corner and we were able to get back to the hotel later in the evening without any problems using public transport the location was also perfect for the trip to the airport the next morning am mackenzie beach is super close and so are lots of cool bars and restaurants
great welcome very pleasant contact very helpful access to the airport is close but not so easy with the bus when you do not know
everything is very good
the accommodation itself is very good it is very central the problem is finding it it is located in an alley and google maps went crazy now i understand why they sent me a photo of how to locate the street surely it is not a problem with the accommodation but the guests in the upper apartment did not stop making noise at am and on the other hand if you go by car even though there is an open air car park very close it is a real odyssey to be able to park we had to leave the car far away

the hotel is very clean and close to the airport simple and comfortable rooms you can see that there is care in the place the restaurant in the hotel lobby is good although it took a relatively long time for our food to be ready
nice clean and neat super sweet hosts
close to the field the staff is nice the room is restful and pleasant clean and renovated
the bed is comfortable and so is the shower the environment is a bit unfriendly for walking there is a lot of construction and the roads are bumpy
everything is a perfect boutique hotel
breakfast was good
cleanliness location simple and modern furnishings but new like the whole structure nothing
the hotel is very modernly furnished the room is spacious enough with an above standard large bathroom we did not use the breakfast because of the early departure the staff at the reception willingly arranged a ride to the airport for us we spent little time at the hotel to assess what could be improved but we have a positive experience and will use it again next time

terrace was very cozy it was very hot but that was the weather
we arrived in the middle of the night and were able to get into the room via self check in without any problems 
good location close to the airport easily accessible by taxi there is also a bus route nearby rooms may be a bit small for a longer stay but since we only stayed one night it was not a problem
the cleaning
location is very close to the beach very kind staff on the last day kept our suitcases in custody for the whole day very close to the airport like minutes by car really soft bed and pillows room a little smaller than average but large bathroom and shower

the rooms are big and very clean there is also a balcony tony the hotel owner is a great man helped us with everything we needed everything will be alright
a very welcoming staff smiling and always available to satisfy you at the reception as in the restaurant there is always someone to take care of you in one of the four languages greek english french or arabic the proximity to the famous mackenzie beach is an asset for this charming hotel the beach is around minutes walk the hotel seems to have been freshened up recently so everything seemed flawless to us
we arrived at the hotel for one night in order to be close to larnaca airport for an early morning flight the rooms are pleasant clean the beds are comfortable everything is new and clean we had a really nice time at this hotel there is nothing we did not like
comfortable room
very kind and welcoming structure ok for the sea
we were received with a beautiful and kind hospitality by the hotel staff clean room pleasant and comfortable bedding there is a kettle and a fridge in the room close to larnaca airport less than minutes bed could be opened and was less comfortable toilet and shower are together and less convenient
lovely and clean room enough for a family with children two rooms the children's third bed was a bit problematic and not very stable the location near the airport is convenient for those who need to fly early in the morning there is also a shuttle to the field there is a lovely promenade on the sea mckenzie beach with worthwhile restaurants very worth going in the evening the staff is charming and kind answers with a smile and agrees to every request the restaurant in the hotel is also great there was a lack of a pool especially when from the window you can see the pool of the nearby hotel but overall a good value for the price we paid
cleanliness first but also the kindness of the staff the breakfast offered by an independent service does not correspond quantitatively and qualitatively to the known levels of cypriot hospitality and gastronomy 
and the price of for breakfast is much more expensive than the reasonable value in terms of quality and quantity of the offered product
explanation for arrival cleanliness nothing
everything i liked everything
excellent location near the airport good for an overnight stay after a late or early morning flight there was no hot water the two nights we slept there and even when we complained they said they took care of it and it was not taken care of
cleanliness kindness of the staff nothing
the room is really clean close to larnaca airport and it was really convenient to stop there because our flight landed in the middle of the night the water in the bath is cold and that we were staying in the middle of august even david shemesh was supposed to arrange boiling soup here
good location 
 hotel rooms are in good condition 
 hotel is not that big room a bit small no seating
we were just passing through before taking the plane but the hotel is located meters from the beach and an area with restaurants bars the town center is a little further ' on foot ' from the airport very nice hosts very clean establishment

location close to the airport
kindness of staff
staff speaks french

excellent location minutes walk from the boardwalk and the airport
the hotel staff is simply charming and kind 
the hotel was recently renovated rooms are in new and clean condition
in addition there is smart technology there are electronic buttons to request cleaning for the room a bell and remote control of the air conditioner if there is a problem 
they upgraded our room for free 
the hotel put us in touch with a taxi driver who took us to visit the mall and charged us decent prices
friendly staff

a comfortable place quiet friendly staff quiet and spacious
friendly people both at the reception and in the restaurant willing to serve the elevator it needs more cleaning and maybe a complete renovation would be better
the calm and comfort of the bedding the balcony the spacious room the blue light on the balcony at night which interferes with sleeping open window
amazing team 
helps with any question and problem smiling and patient 
changed us to a family room that we requested 
they gave us great recommendations for places in the city order taxis for us help with car rental 
they even celebrated our daughter's birthday with a surprise 
in short an experience
everything was excellent personal attention
the restaurant service is very good varied and with good prices the workers are very pleasant and attentive the air conditioning had poor regulation or cold and directly to the body or heat
all nothing

arrival at am just for one night 
the owners left us clear and precise information for our arrival sending us photos 
cleanliness distance from the airport quality of bedding size of the room bottle of water available 
sympathy of the owners in the morning who made the effort to speak french to us 
we recommend eyes closed works next door but unfortunately the owners cannot do anything about it
new hotel everything is clean and fresh we were interested in a hotel near the airport it met our expectations
very varied breakfasts to choose from in the hotel restaurant there were no such elements
cleanliness comfort
the dishes cooked to order are delicious i recommend eating at jasmine garden
liked the hotel newly refurbished clean and tidy nice welcoming staff kindly settled early we had a delicious dinner at the hotel restaurant there is a cozy courtyard parking very uncomfortable folding bed the child at night could not fall asleep with it it is also quite noisy at night you can hear airplanes and music from nightclubs but i think this does not apply to the hotel such a location but it is close to the airport
pleasant staff clean and tidy good food
very clean cheap modern room noisy outside
excellent location a few steps from the sea and from via dei premises in minutes on foot you can also reach the historic center 
excellent breakfast and meals in the restaurant all freshly made 
modern and renovated rooms very comfortable beds slightly small bathroom but still ok
clean modern hotel comfortable rooms
great transit hotel near the airport the room is small but everything is new and very clean comfortable double bed and crisp white linen delicious breakfast in cafe friendly staff side sea view parking noise from a nightclub and not a comfortable cot my child was very cramped there

very friendly reception nice quiet room
clean friendly staff very close to the beach and the airport lots of restaurants nearby relatively quiet location the room is not sealed off from the corridor you can hear everything somewhat small and sterile rooms
clean and comfortable the view from my room
the room was modern with a large and very comfortable bed the shower really good there was also great quiet and it was very easy to set up the room so you would not be disturbed everything very clean the size of the room was just enough to spend one night not much more the ridiculous closet the price is perhaps a little high for the comfort that a room gives you that is small as soon as you enter if i were to go with my partner we would have been disappointed due to the lack of space
close to larnaca airport and min walk to the beach very quiet hotel with a restaurant in the enclosure which is very good the breakfast on the terrace is very nice too
the kindness and availability of the staff the restaurant offering a good quality of dishes 
the comfortable and very clean room the calm
proximity to the city center and the beach 
very good value for money ras
the establishment is really close to the airport i e minutes by car 
the managers of the hotel are extraordinarily kind and caring
they speak french and helped us find a rental car at a good price they accompanied and advised us during our stay 
the room is nice and well furnished
i highly recommend this hotel the small downside concerns the light from the outside at certain times
very good breakfast comfortable bed purely friendly staff not all rooms have a balcony i did not have it staying for one day is fine but if you live for a while then how to dry your towel and swimsuit
very friendly staff and communication with the hotel before our arrival very fluid the rooms are spacious and comfortable 
it is ideally located near the airport min by bus it is a detail but we would have appreciated having small bottles of water in the room when we arrived
very nice staff restaurant and hotel very good we stayed here for one night when we arrived before leaving to visit the island we recommend without any problem very quiet and clean we had ordered a shuttle and thought it was specific to the hotel but it turned out to be just a lambda taxi the problem is that we waited for it for minutes because it was late but nobody warned us we had to pay it straight away when we thought it would be included in the hotel bill at the end of the stay it would be better to indicate directly that it is independent of the hotel we would not have waited in front of other taxis and tried to reach everyone
the reception of the staff the cleanliness and the quality of the room
good central location very nice staff neat small hotel very noisy
cleanliness space location garbage truck at am making a lot of noise
clean
nice clean hotel near the airport the room has everything you need also in minutes you can walk to the embankment the staff are friendly and try to help i booked a room with one bed in fact it was separate beds no one warned about this it was very uncomfortable for me and my husband to sleep having moved the mattresses if i had known from the beginning that there would not be a room with one bed i would have chosen another hotel it spoiled the impression
the owner of the place is an amazing guy nice and answers everything there are breakfasts not a big variety but tasty
super friendly staff and a clean modern room we did not have a balcony it was not bad though as we were only there for one night
good location near the airport and the beach noisy air conditioning and night traffic in the area
nice modern room 
boss and family take care of that
well being of your guests there was nothing to complain about
very good homemade breakfast
when the booked taxi did not show up at in the morning the htl owner drove me to the airport himself after i rang him out of bed
i loved the staff they always greeted us with a smile they were really nice they always responded to the help we needed they called us a taxi they did not charge me again because i lost my room ticket a stunning hotel an aesthetic and clean place with innovative and interesting service that you can really request at the push of a button that you will not be able to hear the bell i have never come across this in my life amazing thank you so much to this hotel a bit far from the city center but taxis cost us the same price from anywhere in the city so it is not critical other than that it is a stunning place
the room and the staff
small modern hotel with very friendly and helpful hosts 
 minute walk from larnaca center and minute walk from beautiful mackenzie beach 
i would love to come back

delicious homemade breakfast they speak french are very caring and welcome you hours a day and very close to the airport
everything was wonderful
kindness
an intimate hotel with service at the highest level 
the cuisine is simple but tasty 
location on close to the beach gastronomy and the airport
a renovated brilliant family hotel with a very friendly staff suited us for a one night stay before a flight we had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was excellent the chef gave a personal touch to understand exactly what we want recommended
perfect location to the airport very friendly reception very clean
location room comfort service and courtesy of the staff everything was perfect
great hotel lovely staff ready to help at any hour
it was very clean the host was very nice he gave us instructions on how to get to the hotel and then even picked us up at the bus stop because we were very late the humid air in the room it was very warm the air conditioning probably did not work properly
very friendly staff very clean everywhere nice room with a nice balcony quiet and peaceful area definitely a hotel worth visiting again all was well
comfortable clean modern pleasant the hosts are very nice they help in everything
welcoming environment courtesy cleanliness modern room i would like more variety at breakfast 
the price to food ratio was disproportionate

the staff is very friendly
the hotel is clean comfortable and a good location very close to salt lake and mackenzie beach very close to bus stop very close to the airport the bus only costs euros to and from the airport from the hotel you can just walk along the entire promenade of larnaca you won t miss anything a calm step along the sea to the church of st lazarus minutes the room was wonderful white bed breakfast can be bought directly at the hotel for only euros i rented a car there is a place to park the shower is wonderful the air conditioner works we were in january it was very warm and sunny everything is great the owner of the hotel was very friendly allowed to leave things even after we checked out i highly recommend
the hotel is very close to the airport all is clear we were given a superior room with a balcony for free unfortunately it was not possible to evaluate everything since we arrived in the evening it was already dark and left for the airport early in the morning it was still dark there are many restaurants and cafes within walking distance from the hotel which was very convenient for us very close to the beach 
we were seated very quickly we left at night with no problems
nice staff just one night to leave early the next day from the airport maybe the reception needs improvement it is very old furniture
new hotel clean comfortable room friendly staff the hotel is located near the airport 
we read reviews that extraneous noise could interfere but we traveled in the off season there was no noise from the street and the sound from landing taking off planes did not particularly bother us the room was small could have been a bit more spacious other than that everything was fine and met our expectations
convenient location with a late arrival and planning further travel by car walking distance to mackenzie beach and salt lake purely no problem with check in after at night parking next to the hotel
large comfortable bed clean linen cozy 
close to the airport minutes by taxi
cleanliness 
everything is white bright cozy 
we spent one night before the plane were very satisfied 
the accommodation is perfect close to the airport nothing to complain about
very nice staff comfortable beds great shower we stayed for one night before flying out of cyprus the option is excellent close to the airport near the lake with flamingos in winter they are drawing a number
i liked the hotel already when approaching it from the street the feeling of the new did not leave all the time starting from the street terrace the hall and up to the room itself clean comfortable with a soft bed as it turned out later the hotel is already about years old but they are doing well 
always friendly staff it looks like a family business but i will not say every day cleaning at any time you can go down to the veranda at the tables and just drink their wonderful cappuccino on soft sofas and then sleep the rest of the night on soft beds 
we did not use the pool the sea is better because there is a good mackenzie beach and he did not have to swim of the minuses sometimes a car came to pick up garbage cans at night more precisely the car poured them into its depths not worrying about the noise and sleeping expensive tourists also mirrors in the room there are plenty of them and they all distorted the image rather made you fatter 
everything else is a plus
very warm and caring welcome the room was very well equipped clean comfortable i was very happy the hotel is not far from the airport but a bit far from city center
nice staff lobby and room very clean
cleanliness
spacious
super nice staff great location and pet friendly we were able to bring our small dog and the hotel was still very clean
it was the cleanest room i have ever been cleanliness is top notch cleaned every day down to the taps towels and white bedding any problems are solved instantly the staff is excellent everyone is definitely polite and smiling very noisy the area is ringing the sounds accumulate with terrible force at night i constantly woke up either from the sounds of airplanes or from passing cars or a slamming trunk earplugs did not save
clean rooms very nice staff comfortable bed
proximity to the airport small but modern rooms good bed very good bathroom those who sleep lightly will be disturbed by the aircraft noise those who are tired sleep over it
nice accommodation parking in the hotel area a beautiful beach within walking distance very helpful staff due to the delay of the plane they waited for us until in the morning beautiful accommodation unfortunately at night it was fertilized in larnaca and the whole city stank perhaps it was only short lived
location
hotel near the airport fast transfer organized by the hotel in total close to the beach although to get to the beach relatively quickly you have to go to the so called shortcuts along a well trodden path through a field and a small escarpment or another way a little around along the streets the center is quite far about km a walk along the beach promenade 
 peace
great modern design comfortable bed clean large with a balcony large bathroom with shower equipped with a kettle plus a welcome pack tea coffee water 
 breakfast
served on site on the ground floor in the dining room with access to the front terrace delicious homemade greek taste pool infrastructure
even though we arrived at a m they waited for us very friendly very clean close to the airport
location close to the airport therefore during the day a lot of noise from planes taking off not heard at night 
breakfast was good but not lavish had to ask for bread beds are soft and with a lot of plastic therefore very sweaty 
in the middle of the night the garbage containers were emptied with a lot of noise
great location as i arrived very late and just wanted to sleep 
you are there now 
quiet location very friendly and helpful staff owners bed a bit uncomfortable 
unfortunately the organized taxi came too late a bit chaotic 
even if the hotel cannot do anything about it
very clean new room perfect bed and towels close location to the bus stop minutes to the center and minutes to the airport friendly staff all wishes and problematic situations are solved immediately an ideal place if you need to spend the night before departure from larnaca mackenzie beach is very noisy windy did not like it not for a long vacation
very clean plenty of parking nice and kind staff
very nice room there was a kettle and a microwave a spacious bath a view of the beautiful houses we were seated in the middle of the night delicious breakfast for a fee on request there is a transfer from the airport and to the airport
the street side rooms are noisier than those facing the back the exceptional welcome in french
proximity to the airport
a nearby bus stop provides access to the city center and the airport
the cleanliness and design of the room
pleasantly surprised as the hotel appears to have been renovated unfortunately the pool was closed
new hotel with super clean rooms and comfortable beds family business and the owners are very friendly
nice homely atmosphere delicious food the owner takes care of the guests to make them feel at home the place is recommended
cozy hotel in a quiet location walking distance to the beach we went with a child walking around is also interesting 
the room is very clean comfortable mattresses excellent clean bedding 
there is only soap in the shower no shower gel keep in mind but we usually go with ours 
very polite and pleasant staff

excellent location perfect cleanliness excellent breakfasts for only super service
the situation extremely close to the airport for a very early departure or a late arrival and extremely close to the beach and its entertainment restaurants bars very quiet though very clean very comfortable brand new very friendly and pleasant welcome
was in the middle of september i really liked the hotel reminds me of a family hostel excellent service staff the owner and staff are always ready to help helped immediately with adapters from the hotel to the beach is relatively close minutes at a calm pace there is a bus stop nearby which is also very important of the shortcomings i would note the monotonous breakfast every day is the same breakfasts this is probably the weakest link in the hotel
very nice owner great hotel close to the beach
the room was spotless and the sheets were musky while we had booked a double room they gave us a bed room with two rooms which made us very happy while we arrived after midnight there was a person at the reception to check in the staff is very kind and helpful we would definitely go again
very convenient location not far from the airport and from the sea very thin walls everything is heard at of the clock in the morning we woke up from the fact that the garbage truck loaded the tanks
location near the airport near mackenzie beach super convenient delicious breakfasts attentive staff five minutes to the beach homer comfortable clean cleaned every day the owners of the hotel helped with all questions if you stop here
very helpful staff if you do not have adapters for sockets ask at the reception quilts too warm for summer
hotel rather well placed access to the beach by crossing a vacant lot airport nearby but the taxi price is the same as from the center of larnaca pleasant surprise it is not in the photo but the accommodation has a swimming pool fridge filled with drinks and delicacies even if it is paying it is nice to have some available too bad the swimming pool is not indicated on the booking site and at the reception of the hotel
close to the airport quietly we reached stops on the bus nd floor entrance for those departing from the airport immediately to the left to the end of the airport building the hosts are very friendly tomorrow is quite meager euros the room is very very small beds at meters but at the same time clean and tidy the area near the hotel is a wasteland wasteland there is nothing most importantly do not go to nearby cafes restaurants never had such a terrible dinner before
very available and caring for his customers the rooms are very well equipped and the breakfast very good and plentiful we arrived at am at the airport a shuttle taxi to the hotel was waiting for us the hotel allowed us at no extra cost a late arrival and a late departure at p m

individual approach responsive staff very clean fresh comfortable you can see it is new cleaning every day i cannot even remember
the hotel is minutes from the airport which is very convenient for not missing your flight 
the welcome was very warm and efficient 
i unfortunately did not try the breakfast or other meal but the hotel is well located for the restaurants in the area the electric kettle did not seem to work but that is a detail
clean comfortable hotel delicious breakfast to the beach on foot minutes only pleasant impressions remain
great bed excellent cleaning great for the airport it is attached small room only one nescafe bag no curtain in the bathroom better remove the photo of the pool since it is a hole
the most important thing about the hotel is the incredible staff very soulful atmosphere

the general manager he is behind the counter in the restaurant made our holiday 
the rooms are clean air conditioned balcony mini bar

very friendly and helpful hotel staff
close to the beach own pleasant breakfast quality eco hotel excellent value for money nothing to say
due to the pandemic my flight was canceled until the next day and i had to spend the night in this hotel i can honestly say that i was satisfied all the furniture in the hotel is new the owners are very good people the bed is comfortable and the breakfast is excellent
nice accommodation extremely clean and with a very good location near the beach and the center with their vanilla styles the rooms offer a very pleasant atmosphere in which to relax and unwind also one thing that sets this hotel apart is their generosity so that they offer a bottle of water tea bags and coffee for free not to mention the affordable prices of the mini bar also note that the staff communicates well in french something that is rare to find in cyprus
there was no running water in the morning when i left do not change it is normal to take a shower
we did not eat noise
uncomfortable beds
comfortable bed not clean
clean and nice room not as close to the airport as advertised
room quality the sounds of the airport
clean and functional breakfast time
the room was satisfactory the lady at the reception who spoke cypriot was kind and willing for any help i did not like the behavior of the gentleman in the reservations i was assured of breakfast in the price of the room upon arrival he refused to provide breakfast in an unacceptable manner and without even speaking the cypriot language my dissatisfaction with the choice is great
a clean room that really serves the purpose for which we came the frozen water in the bath
close to the airport but no aircraft noise
clean
bus station nearby
salt lake nearby minibar was empty and not working
 annoying if you arrive after midnight
and looking forward to a beer
the location is close to the field the room is clean a hotel that is suitable for an overnight stay small rooms there is no view
location close to the field no staff at night
the room was next to another property's pool despite too much noise shouting unable to rest
comfortable room for one night before departure it was extremely noisy
the meal is not included in the price
very good if you have an early morning flight the quality price ratio you should only sleep with air conditioning in the summer because there is a lot of noise from the nearby beach until early morning
very nice staff
central location between the beach the party mile the airport and the old town it would be nice if there was a breakfast buffet
cleaning furniture terrace after minutes of waiting bad and half raw croissant
watery cappuccino
big room receptionist did not understand english very well and the staff could not give me any information about the bus to the airport
the room the lack of adapters for sockets
very good location sound proofing
large spacious suite comfortable beds good for large family people light interior warm blankets slightly untidy floor smelled a little sewage
location good the room smelled of sewage it should never be like this this is a definite minus and prevents coming again
the warm welcome in french the comfort of the beds the cleanliness the noise emanating from the terrace when located on the st floor
breakfast ok 
clean room comfortable bed with the exception of one gentleman at the reception no other employee was wearing a mask 
the small room with almost non existent storage spaces an extremely small balcony 
thin walls all night i heard how other travelers checked in 
at of the clock in the morning the garbage was picked up from the street in an infernal mess 
at of the clock in the morning i tried to open the door to the balcony and i was very close to throwing up instantly it seems that there are some farms nearby it smelled like concentrated manure 
the adapter found in the room burned melted phone chargers
excellent attention very comfortable bed very good shower the furniture and bathroom are all new and impeccable very good wifi connection bars and restaurants nearby in the photo of the room on booking you cannot see a column that takes up space and is uncomfortable the balcony on the first floor is very low not very intimate close to the street and the hotel lobby you can even smell the smoke from the cigarettes that smoke there the safe does not make sense since it is not walled it does not matter if you leave the money in a bag they could put shampoo in the bathroom not just soap since there is a kettle and the room ers for two people they could put coffee sachets and tea sachets not just
cleanliness the room given was not the one booked small corner
clean and spacious room far from the beach the hotel is average stars euros for nights a bit expensive the windows overlooked the courtyard where it was quite noisy
terrace in the room 
 well furnished room and bathroom 
 location of the object monotonous breakfasts everyday the same set eggs slices of toast grilled mushroom grilled tomato pepper small sausages coffee 
 the relaxation zone swimming pool deckchairs billiards definitely did not encourage you to use it
a hotel for those who make a long transfer in cyprus that is hotel for one night 
pros 
 cleanliness
 the beach is within walking distance 
 a couple of taverns in the area
 near the airport we lived for a week
 bed linen was never changed cleaning and change of towels daily 
 the number is microscopic rented nissan micra and then more 
 the refrigerator is full of minibar for money i had to pull everything out so that my products would fit 
 the hotel did not allow to turn over a couple of hours before the delayed plane 
 walk to the promenade of larnaca for about minutes to lidl for an hour and a half 
the hotel is really for one night
clean daily change of towels pleasant and helpful staff value for money there was a constant stench coming from outside lack of storage spaces
clean comfortable nice staff the breakfast is delicious but the same eat what they bring you a fruit van drove under the windows almost every day from early morning and the seller shouted into the mouthpiece walking distance to the center but within walking distance of mackenzie beach and all party cafes 
poor soundproofing from corridor
new equipment good accessibility for reptiles could not close one window
location and calm
comfortable and clean room good location and kind staff difficulties with the different sockets as they provided devices without adapters
perfect welcome even arriving at am what we expect for this perfect price nothing
very friendly and warm service very clean and new rooms proximity to the beach and airport
wonderful hotel with a cozy homely atmosphere responsive staff always with a smile delicious inexpensive breakfast options a couple of days after arrival we changed the room from a one room to a two room with a balcony
perfect welcome at in the morning 
excellent value 
close to the airport
the location close to the airport while being quiet
check in at am
an exceptional welcome in french
the room is clean large enough and recent
the outdoor balcony is a plus
the proximity to the beach and the city is a significant asset
there is a bus stop near the hotel which allows you to go to the city center and to the airport 
i recommend nothing except the breakfast served at the bar next door too frugal for the price and very slow service
cozy hotel nice room large room size location near mackenzie beach
a friendly nice and sympathetic man serving breakfast bed frame structure dangerous sharp corners
excellent location close to everything
lovely quiet and cozy hotel minutes from the beach and the airport 
crisp white linens small but cozy and very clean room for a reasonable price we extended our stay in the room for half a day due to the constantly shifting departure of the plane 
very pleasant and helpful staff 
thank you
the service
the stay is worth it only for sleeping before departure very kind and helpful staff bad degraded area garbage heap in the bin next to the hotel not as clean as it should be inside misleading photos
