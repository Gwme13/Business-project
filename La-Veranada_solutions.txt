**3. Technical Issues:**

* **Regular Maintenance:**  Implement a strict maintenance schedule to address any technical issues promptly. This includes regular checks on air conditioning units, water systems, Wi-Fi equipment, and other facilities.
* **Guest Feedback System:** Establish a system to collect and address guest feedback regarding technical issues. This can be done through online surveys, comment cards, or staff communication.
